# Shoes-Store
Simulation of a  Store's main page  

In this responsive project I used:

  HTML5:
      - semantic concepts, for the whole 
        structure(iframe, form, section, article);
        
   CSS3:
      -flexbox concept;
      - without any framework or library;
      
     JS:
      -Basic alert message in some buttons;
